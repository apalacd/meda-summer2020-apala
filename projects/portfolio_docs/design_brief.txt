The project was about process improvements and global implementation of Oracle 11i E-Business ERP modules with an objective to reduce operational risk, remove redundancy and increase efficiency.

In role of a Project Team Manager/Technologist, I managed Order Management internal and offshore sub-teams in feasibility study, business functions impact to Asia Pacific and Canada(APAC), Latin America & Europe. Facilitated and conducted business flows mappings to oracle workflows, business and technical gap analysis, QA and cross-functional UAT.

Implement a DNS Screening web service against Denied & Restricted Party List issued by the US Government Customs Department. EDI was used for document transfer and picked up through web service calls to upload changes into data warehouse. Compliance checks and cross-validations were introduced against customers, resellers and vendors at every interaction level within the system as well.

My role as a team lead : Defined scope of project deliverables in collaboration with stakeholders. Wrote use cases, QA tested, logged and tracked bugs, filling in as a team resource. Ensured a smooth integration with existing Oracle application modules. 

This project was a significantly critical enhancement that prevented the organization’s business from getting into legal issues with customs, export compliance and security lapses.
